* Made CAD for the Heated Build Plate (will eventually have to design PCB).
* Began to design the Heated Build Plate Holder.

The current plan is to have the Heated Build Plate holder to be laser-cut or routed out of Polycarbonate, with polycarbonate spacers to hold the Heated Build plate in place. The Heated Build Plate is 180mm in diameter.

### 4/18/2014
* Began CAD for Heated Build Plate Pulley Block

The Heated Build Plate Pulley Block will be bolted to the polycarbonate Heated Build Plate Holder, with a 6.5mm tall GT2 pulley in-between the Heated Build Plate Holder and the part that bolts the two together. I'll upload some STLs soon, so that everything is easier to understand. I'm currently having a hard time figuring out how to CAD a GT2 Pulley tooth profile, however.
