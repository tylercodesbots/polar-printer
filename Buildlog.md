* Made CAD for the Heated Build Plate (will eventually have to design PCB).
* Began to design the Heated Build Plate Holder.
The current plan is to have the Heated Build Plate holder to be laser-cut or routed out of Polycarbonate, with polycarbonate spacers to hold the Heated Build plate in place. The Heated Build Plate is 180mm in diameter.
