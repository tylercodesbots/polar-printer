Polar Printer
=============

A 3D Printer utilizing polar coordinates, rather a cartesian system.

This is a work in progress of mine that I hope to flesh out into a commercial system at some point, possibly even writing my own printer firmware.

Design Paradigms
----------------
1. As many parts as possible should be possible to create using a 3D Printer, or household tools (a la reprap).
2. This printer should use as few non-printed parts (fasteners, stepper motors, etc.) as possible, while still maintaining a robust, easy to use system.
3. Primary focus on print quality, secondary focus on print speed 

"Mandatory" Features
--------------------
+ Heated Build Plate
+ Enclosed build area
+ ~1600π cm^3^ build volume

Cool Features to Look Into
--------------------------
+ Positive pressure build area
+   + This should ensure that drafts and other exterior temperature phenomena do not affect prints.
+ "drag and drop" printing.
+   + Printing should be as easy as putting a file on an SD card, then inserting the card in the printer.
+ All metal extruder?
